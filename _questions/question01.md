### Description 

In this first visualization, our aim is to visualize what kind of sources—according to [Amazon Alexa Share of Voice tool](https://www.alexa.com/)—the online users use to make themselves an opinion about Hate Speech, and how these sources can influence them.

On the X axis are displayed the seven categories of opinions in which we clustered the definitions that were given by all the sites we collected. Each opinion has a different color grading in order to help reading the graph and to better identify the different opinions. The y axis shows the six types of site sources.
The radius that define the dimensions of the circles corresponds to the Network share level of the “Hate Speech” query, according to Alexa.

As it arises from the visualization the opinions tend to be at the opposite and not neutral. Moreover, most of the sites give definitions of Hate Speech that encourage to regulate the phenomenon by law. The most used source is Wikipedia, which stands out between all the others, and therefore it will be deeply analyzed in the next three protocols. 


### Protocol

We based this very first protocol on the classification made by [Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/), using the Share Of Voice tool. We queried “Hate Speech” and we manually scraped the data about all the sites that Alexa gave back, organizing them by ordered rows, which correspond to the position in the rank. Each site that resulted from Alexa was assigned to one of the six categories that we had defined: “Organizations/Association”, “News”, “Social Network/Media Company”, “Reference”, “University” and “Forum”. 

At this point we decided to go even deeper, analyzing the various definitions of Hate Speech that were given by those sites, clustering them in seven different categories that corresponds to a specific opinion about the Hate Speech debate: “Hate speech leads to hate crime”, “Hate speech is harmful and needs to be regulated”, “Hate speech must be fought with more speech”, “We still don’t know what hate speech is”, “Hate speech is hate speech only when it causes real reactions”, “Hate speech is free speech”, “Hate speech is a construct used to kill free speech”. The Excel file that resulted was uploaded on [RawGraphs](https://rawgraphs.io/) in order to start displaying the data; the resulting SVG file was later refined with Adobe Illustrator.
