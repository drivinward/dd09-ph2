### Description 

During the analysis of the users' opinions regarding Hate Speech implemented in protocol 4.1 and the initial overview of protocol 1 of all the definitions of Hate Speech, it was highlighted several times the need and the importance of regulating this phenomenon in order to avoid the damage that could derive from it. Moreover, from these comments it appears that this need is often strongly felt in a reality like the web, which has always been characterized by almost complete freedom.
Regulating the proliferation of hatred in an online environment involves the use of filtering mechanisms, often referred to as censorship. In fact, on the opposite side, as emerged from the previous analysis, there is an equally powerful voice that accuses this search for moderation to generate episodes of abuse of power.

Therefore, we decided to show how the discussion about filtering and censorship develops on online platforms.
The sites that express themselves on the subject have been represented with black strokes around the relative nodes. In order not to lose the controversial value of the discussion the color of the edges that originate from the platform is painted with blue if the type of speech was about filtering and orange if instead it was about censorship. The arrows lead to those who are mentioned in the speech, those spoken of. The diameter of the circumferences derives from the number of times they have been mentioned, while the color depends in percentage if they have been mentioned regarding filtering or censorship. 

Therefore, the protocol shows which platforms deal with the topic, whether they speak in terms of filtering or censorship and above all who are the main actors in the conversation, i.e. those who are asked to take a position, those who have the power to act and bear the weight of judgment from the internet community. Moreover, it highlights the importance that the ITC companies play in this discussion and the fact that they are often accused of censorship. 
In addition, the figure of Nadine Strossen emerges, a writer who supports the idea that proposes to fight Hate Speech with Free Speech and not censorship.
Also the EU and the US stand out from the visualization because of the different legislative conduct and mindset regarding Hate Speech, which often cause discussions on the theme.

### Protocol

As a first step we wanted to discover what users could find on Wikipedia about filtering methods. We found out that there isn’t a Wikipedia page about this topic, so we had to search for information in a different way. 
We browsed Google privately in Incognito mode with Firefox and we analyzed the topic with two different queries: “Hate Speech & Filtering” and “Hate Speech & Censorship”. 
We decided to use both queries because there is a controversy between the two terms: “Filtering” itself has a positive connotation but there are people who believe that it is only a nice way to censor contents.

We created an Excel file where we started to collect the first 50 results for both queries, reporting also the Google rank.
After this first step, we analyzed the structure of every site and we collected information about the actors which shared the content, the date in which the content was posted online and the sites typology according to [WebPulse Site Review tool](https://sitereview.bluecoat.com/#/).

After these sites’ categorization, we analyzed what are the most frequents words used in each site according to [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/). We compared the obtained results with a manual research on the site, paying attention to the title of each article to underline what are the most important authorities in the debate and also the most shared opinions.
