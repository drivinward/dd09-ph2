### Description

As we noticed in the last protocol, we can observe a correlation between Hate Speech and violent behaviours. Indeed, there seems to be a pattern by which hate speech often results in violent events recognized as hate crime. We therefore decided to investigate how are these terms related to each other, trying to understand some of the relevant features they have in common. In order to do so, we identified and analyzed the “See Also” pages in Wikipedia related to the Hate Speech and Hate Crime pages.

As a result, the graph shows the main nodes which are the starting poles of the map (Hate Speech and Hate Crime) and the connected results of their “See Also” connections.

The diameter of the nodes depends on the interest for the page, i.e. the number of total views of the Wikipedia page from 07/01/2015 to 11/17/2018. 

The color of the nodes classifies the degrees of separation between the connected topics and the starting poles. We can therefore observe that the pages which directly link Hate Speech to Hate Crime with one degree of separation are: “Freedom of thought”, “Thoughtcrime”, “Hate mail” and “Gay bashing”. Trying to collect these results by their overall topic we defined which are the main and recurring macro-categories in the map, that can be described as the main themes that characterize the correlation between Hate Speech and Hate Crime: “Racial Discrimination”, “Racist organizations”, “Racial based violence”, “LGBT Discrimination”, “Violence”, “Discrimination”, “Hate Speech vs. Free Speech”, “Historical” and “Political”.
